## Getting started
### Preparing the data
First, make sure you have the ldp data downloaded and stored in the 'data' folder. Make sure to name the file 'ldp_data.csv'. You will also need the first names dataset, so download that and store it as 'first_names.csv' in the data folder as well. 
Then, navigate to the 'code' folder in your terminal. From there, run 
```
test
```
